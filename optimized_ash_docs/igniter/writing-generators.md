#  [ __ View Source ](external_link) Writing Generators

In [`Igniter`](external_link), generators are done as a wrapper around [`Mix.Task`](external_link), allowing them to be called individually or composed as part of a task.

Since an example is worth a thousand words, lets take a look at an example that generates a file and ensures a configuration is set in the user's `config.exs`.

> ###  __ An igniter for igniters?!
> 
> Run `mix igniter.gen.task your_app.task.name` to generate a new, fully configured igniter task!
    
    
    # lib/mix/tasks/your_lib.gen.your_thing.ex
    defmodule Mix.Tasks.YourLib.Gen.YourThing do
      use Igniter.Mix.Task
    
      def igniter(igniter, [module_name | _ ] = argv) do
        module_name = Igniter.Code.Module.parse(module_name)
        path = Igniter.Code.Module.proper_location(module_name)
        app_name = Igniter.Project.Application.app_name(igniter)
    
        igniter
        |> Igniter.create_new_elixir_file(path, """
        defmodule #{inspect(module_name)} do
          use YourLib.Thing
    
          ...some_code
        end
        """)
        |> Igniter.Project.Config.configure(
          "config.exs",
          app_name,
          [:list_of_things],
          [module_name],
          &Igniter.Code.List.prepend_new_to_list(&1, module_name)
        )
      end
    end

Now, your users can run

`mix your_lib.gen.your_thing MyApp.MyModuleName`

and it will present them with a diff, creating a new file and updating their `config.exs`.

Additionally, other generators can "compose" this generator using [`Igniter.compose_task/3`](external_link)
    
    
    igniter
    |> Igniter.compose_task(Mix.Tasks.YourLib.Gen.YourThing, ["MyApp.MyModuleName"])
    |> Igniter.compose_task(Mix.Tasks.YourLib.Gen.YourThing, ["MyApp.SomeOtherName"])

##  __ Writing a library installer

Igniter will look for a mix task called `your_library.install` when a user runs `mix igniter.install your_library`. As long as it has the correct name, it will be run automatically as part of installation!

##  __ Navigating the Igniter Codebase

A large part of writing generators with igniter is leveraging our built-in suite of tools for working with zippers and AST, as well as our off-the-shelf patchers for making project modifications. The codebase is split up into four primary divisions:

  * `Igniter.Project.*` \- project-level, off-the-shelf patchers
  * `Igniter.Code.*` \- working with zippers and manipulating source code
  * `Igniter.Mix.*` \- mix tasks, tools for writing igniter mix tasks
  * `Igniter.Util.*` \- various utilities and helpers
