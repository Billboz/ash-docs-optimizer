#  AshPolicyAuthorizer.FilterCheck behaviour (ash_policy_authorizer v0.16.5) [ View Source ](external_link)

A type of check that is represented by a filter statement

That filter statement can be templated, currently only supporting `{:_actor, field}` which will replace that portion of the filter with the appropriate field value from the actor and `{:_actor, :_primary_key}` which will replace the value with a keyword list of the primary key fields of an actor to their values, like `[id: 1]`. If the actor is not present `{:_actor, field}` becomes `nil`, and `{:_actor, :_primary_key}` becomes `false`.

You can customize what the "negative" filter looks like by defining `reject/1`. This is important for filters over related data. For example, given an `owner` relationship and a data layer like `ash_postgres` where `column != NULL` does _not_ evaluate to true (see postgres docs on NULL for more):
    
    
    # The opposite of
    `owner.id == 1`
    # in most cases is not
    `not(owner.id == 1)`
    # because in postgres that would be `NOT (owner.id = NULL)` in cases where there was no owner
    # A better opposite would be
    `owner.id != 1 or is_nil(owner.id)`
    # alternatively
    `not(owner.id == 1) or is_nil(owner.id)`

By being able to customize the `reject` filter, you can use related filters in your policies. Without it, they will likely have undesired effects.
