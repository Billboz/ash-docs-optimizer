#  [ __ View Source ](external_link) Reactor.Executor.Async (reactor v0.9.1)

Handle the asynchronous execution of a batch of steps, along with any mutations to the reactor or execution state.

#  __ Summary

##  Functions

collect_remaining_tasks_for_shutdown(reactor, state)

When the Reactor needs to shut down for any reason, we need to await all the currently running asynchronous steps and delete any task vertices.

handle_completed_steps(reactor, state)

Handle zero or one completed async steps and then decide what to do.

start_steps(reactor, state, steps, supervisor \\\ {:via, PartitionSupervisor, {Reactor.TaskSupervisor, self()}})

Start as many of the provided steps as possible.

      | {:error, [any](external_link)()}

Start as many of the provided steps as possible.

Takes into account he maximum concurrency and available work slots.
