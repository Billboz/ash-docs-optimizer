#  [ __ View Source ](external_link) Reactor.Builder.Compose (reactor v0.9.1)

Handle composition of Reactors for the builder.

The composition logic was getting complicated enough that it seemed sensible to extract it from the builder - if only to aid readability.

You should not use this module directly, but instead use [`Reactor.Builder.compose/4`](external_link).
