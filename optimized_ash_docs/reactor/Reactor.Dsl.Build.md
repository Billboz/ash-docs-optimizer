#  [ __ View Source ](external_link) Reactor.Dsl.Build protocol (reactor v0.9.1)

A protocol which DSL entities must implement.

#  __ Summary

##  Types

t()

All the types that implement this protocol.

##  Functions

build(entity, reactor)

Build an entity into a Reactor.

verify(entity, dsl_state)

Perform any after-compilation verification that is needed to make the entity work.

    @spec build(t(), [Reactor.t](external_link)()) :: {:ok, [Reactor.t](external_link)()} | {:error, [any](external_link)()}

Build an entity into a Reactor.

This function is called during conversion of a DSL module into a Reactor struct. This allows extensions to specify the behaviour of how they want to alter the structure of the Reactor.
