#  [ __ View Source ](external_link) mix ash_sqlite.rollback (ash_sqlite v0.1.3)

Reverts applied migrations in the given repository. Migrations are expected at "priv/YOUR_REPO/migrations" directory of the current application but it can be configured by specifying the `:priv` key under the repository configuration. Runs the latest applied migration by default. To roll back to a version number, supply `--to version_number`. To roll back a specific number of times, use `--step n`. To undo all applied migrations, provide `--all`.

This is only really useful if your domain or domains only use a single repo. If you have multiple repos and you want to run a single migration and/or migrate/roll them back to different points, you will need to use the ecto specific task, [`mix ecto.migrate`](external_link) and provide your repo name.

##  __ Examples
