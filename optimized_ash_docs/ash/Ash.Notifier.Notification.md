#  [ __ View Source ](external_link) Ash.Notifier.Notification (ash v3.4.8)

Represents a notification that will be handled by a resource's notifiers

Set the `for` key to a notifier or a list of notifiers to route the notification to them. This allows you to produce notifications inside of a `change` module and target specific notifiers with them.

`metadata` is freeform data to be set however you want. `resource`, `action`, `data`, `changeset` and `actor` are all set by default based on the details of the action, so they can be omitted.

When creating a notification, a resource is required to ensure that the notification isn't sent until the current transaction for that resource is closed. If you don't need this behavior you can explicitly supply `nil` for the resource. If you supply `nil` for the resource, however, you must manually set the `for` option, e.g: `for: Notifier` or `for: [Notifier1, Notifier2]`
