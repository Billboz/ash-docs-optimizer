#  [ __ View Source ](external_link) Ash.Page.Keyset (ash v3.4.8)

A page of results from `keyset` based pagination.

The results are generated with a `keyset` metadata, which can be used to fetch the next/previous pages.

non_executable_binary_to_term(binary, opts)

A restricted version of [`:erlang.binary_to_term/2`](external_link) that forbids _executable_ terms, such as anonymous functions. The `opts` are given to the underlying [`:erlang.binary_to_term/2`](external_link) call, with an empty list as a default. By default this function does not restrict atoms, as an atom interned in one node may not yet have been interned on another (except for releases, which preload all code). If you want to avoid atoms from being created, then you can pass `[:safe]` as options, as that will also enable the safety mechanisms from [`:erlang.binary_to_term/2`](external_link) itself.
