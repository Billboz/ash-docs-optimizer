# build_trigger(record, trigger, opts \\\ [])

[ __ View Source ](external_link)

Builds a specific trigger for the record provided, but does not insert it into the database.

##  __ Options

  * `:actor` \- the actor to set on the job. Requires configuring an actor persister.



All other options are passed through to [`Oban.Worker.new/2`](external_link)

__ Link to this function

# config(domains, base, opts \\\ [])

[ __ View Source ](external_link)

Alters your oban configuration to include the required AshOban configuration.

# Options

  * `:require?` ([`boolean/0`](external_link)) - Whether to require queues and plugins to be defined in your oban config. This can be helpful to allow the ability to split queues between nodes. See <https://hexdocs.pm/oban/splitting-queues.html> The default value is `true`.

    @spec schedule_and_run_triggers(
      triggerable() | [triggerable()],
      [keyword](external_link)()
    ) :: result()

Runs the schedulers for the given resource, domain, or otp_app, or list of resources, domains, or otp_apps.

Options:

  * `drain_queues?` \- Defaults to false, drains the queues after scheduling. This is primarily for testing
  * `queue`, `with_limit`, `with_recursion`, `with_safety`, `with_scheduled` \- passed through to [`Oban.drain_queue/2`](external_link), if it is called
  * `scheduled_actions?` \- Defaults to false, unless a scheduled action name was explicitly provided. Schedules all applicable scheduled actions.
  * `triggers?` \- Defaults to true, schedules all applicable scheduled actions.
  * `actor` \- The actor to schedule and run the triggers with
  * `oban` \- The oban module to use. Defaults to [`Oban`](external_link)



If the input is:

  * a list - each item is passed into `schedule_and_run_triggers/1`, and the results are merged together.
  * an otp_app - each domain configured in the `ash_domains` of that otp_app is passed into `schedule_and_run_triggers/1`, and the results are merged together.
  * a domain - each reosurce configured in that domain is passed into `schedule_and_run_triggers/1`, and the results are merged together.
  * a tuple of {resource, :trigger_name} - that trigger is scheduled, and the results are merged together.
  * a resource - each trigger configured in that resource is scheduled, and the results are merged together.
